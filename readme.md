## Architecture Choice

I choose Laravel to develop the URL hashing system because of the following reasons: 

- Rapid Development: As Laravel provides the basic setup to start the development as soon as possible, due to which I was able to start working on the APIs.
- Elegant Features: As Laravel includes various other features such as Eloquent ORM, routing system which can greatly speed up development time. Also, the inbuilt helpers provided in the Laravel for url, I was more focussed towards working on my logic for the applications rather than working from scratch for basic things.
- MVC Architecture: Laravel is based on Model-View-Controller architecture. Each has its own use, which promotes code organization, maintainability, and reusability.
- Routing System: Due to easy routing system of Laravel, I was able to build clean and readable apis.
- Testing: Laravel comes with PhpUnit which is useful for tesing the application. Laravel saves a lot of time without much need to integrate the PhpUnit and the developer can be more focused on writing tests for the application.

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications. Building URL hashing system with Laravel is a breeze.
